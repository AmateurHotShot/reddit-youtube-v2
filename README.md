# reddit-youtube-v2
A program that scrapes videos off of Reddit and posts them as YouTube Shorts, currently running off of a Raspberry Pi

I like watching fun Meme compilations with my wife, and I kept thinking how simple it would be to start a YouTube channel using videos 
that were automatically scraped from specific subreddits. 

The itch became unbareable, so I cracked my knuckles and got to work.


This takes a list of subreddits as input, then outputs videos in the portrait format, automatically posted to my YouTube channel (which now has over 1,200 subscribers, completely passively).
